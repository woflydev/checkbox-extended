# Obsidian Checkbox Extended

## IMPORTANT!
I'm not going to be updating this snippet anymore, as its functionality was moved to my custom theme, which you can find at [woflydev/wofflix](https://github.com/woflydev/wofflix). It still works completely fine as a standalone though!

## About
A CSS snippet for extending [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)'s default markdown checkbox functionality.

Make sure you have the [Obsidian Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin installed for additional settings. Alternatively, you could go into the nitty-gritty of the code and just change it there yourself if that suits you.

You can also integrate this with the [Obsidian Task Collector](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-task-collector) plugin to make checking off things much faster!
